          <p>Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy goods 
              or services from a seller over the Internet using a web browser or a mobile app. Consumers 
              find a product of interest by visiting the website of the retailer directly or by searching 
              among alternative vendors using a shopping search engine, which displays the same product's 
              availability and pricing at different e-retailers. As of 2020, customers can shop online using 
              a range of different computers and devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablet 
              computers and smartphones.</p>
              <p>An online shop evokes the physical analogy of buying products or services at a regular 
                  "bricks-and-mortar" retailer or shopping center; the process is called business-to-consumer 
                  (B2C) online shopping. When an online store is set up to enable businesses to buy from another
                   businesses, the process is called business-to-business (B2B) online shopping. A typical online 
                   store enables the customer to browse the firm's range of products and services, view photos or 
                   images of the products, along with information about the product specifications, features and prices.</p>
                   <p>Online stores usually enable shoppers to use "search" features to find specific models, 
                       brands or items. Online customers must have access to the Internet and a valid method of 
                       payment in order to complete a transaction, such as a credit card, an Interac-enabled debit 
                       card, or a service such as PayPal. For physical products (e.g., paperback books or clothes),
                        the e-tailer ships the products to the customer; for digital products, such as digital 
                        audio files of songs or software, the e-tailer usually sends the file to the customer over 
                        the Internet. The largest of these online retailing corporations are Alibaba, Amazon.com, 
                        and eBay.[1]</p>
                        <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">History of online shopping</h3>
                        <p>One of the earliest forms of trade conducted online was IBM's online transaction processing 
                            (OLTP) developed in the 1960s and it allowed the processing of financial transactions in
                             real-time.[2] The computerized ticket reservation system developed for American Airlines 
                             called Semi-Automatic Business Research Environment (SABRE) was one of its applications.
                              Here, computer terminals located in different travel agencies were linked to a large IBM 
                              mainframe computer, which processed transactions simultaneously and coordinated them so 
                              that all travel agents had access to the same information at the same time.[2]</p>
                              <p>The emergence of online shopping as we know today developed with the emergence of the
                                   Internet.[3] Initially, this platform only functioned as an advertising tool for 
                                   companies, providing information about its products. It quickly moved on from this 
                                   simple utility to actual online shopping transaction due to the development of 
                                   interactive Web pages and secure transmissions.[4] Specifically, the growth of the
                                    internet as a secure shopping channel has developed since 1994, with the first sales
                                     of Sting album 'Ten Summoner's Tales'.[5] Wine, chocolates, and flowers soon 
                                     followed and were among the pioneering retail categories which fueled the growth 
                                     of online shopping. Researchers found that having products that are appropriate 
                                     for e-commerce was a key indicator of Internet success.[6] Many of these products
                                      did well as they are generic products which shoppers did not need to touch and 
                                      feel in order to buy. But also importantly, in the early days, there were few 
                                      shoppers online and they were from a narrow segment: affluent, male, 30+. Online 
                                      shopping has come along way since these early days and -in the UK- accounts for 
                                      significant percents (depending on product category as percentages can vary).</p>
                                      <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Impact of reviews on consumer behavior</h3>
                                      <p>One of the great benefits of online shopping is the ability to read product reviews,
                                           written either by experts or fellow online shoppers. The Nielsen Company conducted 
                                           a survey in March 2010 and polled more than 27,000 Internet users in 55 markets 
                                           from the Asia-Pacific, Europe, Middle East, North America, and South America to 
                                           look at questions such as "How do consumers shop online?", "What do they intend 
                                           to buy?", "How do they use various online shopping web pages?", and the impact
                                            of social media and other factors that come into play when consumers are trying
                                             to decide how to spend their money on which product or service. According to
                                              the research,[48] reviews on electronics (57%) such as DVD players, cellphones,
                                               or PlayStations, and so on, reviews on cars (45%), and reviews on software 
                                               (37%) play an important role in influencing consumers who tend to make purchases
                                                online. Furthermore, 40% of online shoppers indicate that they would not even 
                                                buy electronics without consulting online reviews first.</p>
                                                <p>In addition to online reviews, peer recommendations on online shopping pages 
                                                    or social media websites play a key role[49] for online shoppers when they are 
                                                    researching future purchases.[50] 90% of all purchases made are influenced by 
                                                    social media.[51]</p>
